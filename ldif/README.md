## Model Directory Tree
The first thing to do is to decide on a directory structure. One of the very
popular ways of defining the roots of an organization directory tree:
* Use the organization's domain name. For example, if the company has
  registered "tomosolutions.com" domain name, then the root DN would be
composed of of three domain component (dc) attributes:
 **** dc=tomosolutions,dc=com
